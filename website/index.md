Artificial intelligence is an area of computer science which focuses on granting machines the ability to act intelligently. It's a vast field with limitless applications and each application has its own unique solution. Nowadays we see artificial intelligence everywhere from spam filters to movie recommendations to virtual assistants to self-driving. Moreover, customers are demanding more and more smart capabilities in their machines.

According to research, customer satisfaction drops rapidly if it takes longer than half a second for a response. For a great customer experience, latency and throughput are really important during inference. There are many ways latency and throughput can be improved.

In this project, we aim to improve latency and throughput by implementing and deploying an AI application on a distributed system. As a proof of concept, we will choose an AI application which has a complex inference pipeline and distribute the tasks over a distributed system.
